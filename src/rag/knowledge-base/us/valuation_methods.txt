### 3.1 Comparable-Based Valuation

**Method:**
Comparable sales are filtered by:

- Size (square footage range)
- Sale recency (typically last 6-12 months)

**Adjustments Applied:**
- Square footage differences
- Age of property
- Condition/renovation status
- Parking availability
- Amenities (pool, garage, etc.)
- School district quality
- Neighborhood characteristics

**Output:**
- Estimated value range
- Confidence score based on comparable quality
- Adjustment factors applied

### 3.2 Machine Learning AVM

**Models:**
- LightGBM (recommended)
- XGBoost (alternative)

- Bedrooms and bathrooms
- Year built / age
- Location (lat/lon, census tract)

- Days on market
- Property type
- Lot size

**Outputs:**
